Patented temperature drift curvature correction techniques minimize nonlinearity of the voltage change with temperature. The wide operating range and low power consumption make them ideal for 3 V to 5 V battery-powered applications.},

abstract = {In today's market, power management is more important than ever. Portable systems strive to extend battery life while meeting an ever increasing demand for higher performance. Load switches provide a simple and inexpensive method for the system to make the appropriate power management decisions based on which peripherals or sub−circuits are currently in use. Load switches are found in notebooks, cell phones, hand held gaming systems and many other portable devices. The load switch is controlled by the system, and connects or disconnects a voltage rail to a specific load. By turning unused circuitry off, the system as a whole can run more efficiently. The load switch provides a simple means to power a load when it is in demand and allows the system to maximize performance.},

@incollection{TimeDelay,
abstract = {You suddenly notice a ball flying toward your head. Your first reaction happens after a delay. To avoid the ball, you must consider where your head will be after its delayed response in relation to where the ball will be. This chapter presents models for delay dynamics and discusses a control method that compensates for delays. 13.1 Background Delays often occur in the signals that flow between components of a control system. An uncompensated delay may reduce system performance. Suppose, for example, that the sensor measuring the system output, y, requires $\delta$ time units to process and pass on its measured value as a feedback signal. The delayed feedback signal reports the system output $\delta$ time units before the current time, which we write as y(t − $\delta$). The calculated error between the current reference input and the delayed feedback, r(t) − y(t − $\delta$), may not accurately reflect the true error between the target value and the current system output value, r(t) − y(t). Delays may destabilize a system. If the calculated error overestimates the true error, then the system may overcompensate, pushing the system output away from the target reference value rather than toward it. The robust control methods discussed in earlier chapters can reduce the insta-bilities created by delays. Robust control creates a significant stability margin. A large stability margin means that factors not directly included in the design, such as unknown delays, will usually not destabilize the system.},

AN-850 [2] provides a broad, physical description of the switching process. This application note goes into more detail on the switching behavior of the MOSFET when used in a practical application circuit and attempts to enable the reader / designer to choose the right device for the application using the minimum available information from the datasheet. The note goes through several methods of assessing the switching performance of the MOSFET and compares these methods against practical results.
