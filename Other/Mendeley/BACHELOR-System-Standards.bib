abstract = {Conclusion. The potential severity and persistence of ASI symptoms has significant clinical and medico-legal implications. With the rapid growth of call centres around the world, professionals providing tinnitus and hyperacusis therapy are increasingly likely to encounter some or all of the cluster of ASI symptoms in their clients. Background. Acoustic shock injury (ASI), occurring as a result of exposure to a sudden unexpected loud sound, has been observed to cause a specific and consistent pattern of neurophysiological and psychological symptoms. These include aural pain, tinnitus, hyperacusis/phonophobia, vertigo and other unusual symptoms such as numbness or burning sensations around the ear. A range of emotional reactions including trauma, anxiety and depression can develop. Call centre staff using a telephone headset or handset are vulnerable to ASI because of the increased likelihood of exposure, close to their ear(s), of sudden unexpected loud sounds randomly transmitted via the telephone line. Discussion. This paper presents an overview of a study of 103 people exposed to 123 acoustic incidents, and of the proposed neurophysiological mechanism of ASI, in particular tonic tensor tympani syndrome (TTTS). An understanding of TTTS has the potential to provide insight into the neurophysiological and psychological development of tinnitus and hyperacusis and the association with high levels of emotional trauma and anxiety. Rehabilitation. ASI rehabilitation is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2006 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract = {Recommendation ITU-T P.57 specifies the electro-acoustical characteristics of artificial ears to be used for telephonometric measurements. Three devices are specified: a telephone band type for measurements on traditional telephone sets, an insert earphone type and a type faithfully reproducing the characteristics of the human ear. The latter type (type 3) is specified in four configurations. The requirements of the third one (type 3.3 – Pinna simulator) have been slightly modified in this revision of Recommendation ITU-T P.57 by specifying its construction by a softer elastomer. Besides this, the description of the applicability of all couplers has been changed, now allowing for an overlap in their usability according to the receiver type under test.},
