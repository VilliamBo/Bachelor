abstract = {In today's market, power management is more important than ever. Portable systems strive to extend battery life while meeting an ever increasing demand for higher performance. Load switches provide a simple and inexpensive method for the system to make the appropriate power management decisions based on which peripherals or sub−circuits are currently in use. Load switches are found in notebooks, cell phones, hand held gaming systems and many other portable devices. The load switch is controlled by the system, and connects or disconnects a voltage rail to a specific load. By turning unused circuitry off, the system as a whole can run more efficiently. The load switch provides a simple means to power a load when it is in demand and allows the system to maximize performance.},

@article{Vishay2016,
abstract = {This note is part of a series of application notes that define the fundamental behavior of MOSFETs, both as standalone devices and as switching devices implemented in a Switch Mode Power Supply (SMPS). Vishay Application Note AN-605 [1] provides a basic description of the MOSFET and the terminology behind the device, including definitions and physical structure. AN-850 [2] provides a broad, physical description of the switching process. This application note goes into more detail on the switching behavior of the MOSFET when used in a practical application circuit and attempts to enable the reader / designer to choose the right device for the application using the minimum available information from the datasheet. The note goes through several methods of assessing the switching performance of the MOSFET and compares these methods against practical results. Several definitions used within the text are drawn from application note AN-605},
