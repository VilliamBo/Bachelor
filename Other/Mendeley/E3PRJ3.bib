@techreport{SN754410_H_bridge_datasheet,
abstract = {• Designed for Positive-Supply Applications • Wide Supply-Voltage Range of 4.5 V to 36 V • TTL-and CMOS-Compatible High-Impedance Diode-Clamped Inputs • Separate Input-Logic Supply • Thermal Shutdown • Internal ESD Protection • Input Hysteresis Improves Noise Immunity • 3-State Outputs • Minimized Power Dissipation • Sink/Source Interlock Circuitry Prevents Simultaneous Conduction • No Output Glitch During Power Up or Power Down • Improved Functional Replacement for the SGS L293 description The SN754410 is a quadruple high-current half-H driver designed to provide bidirectional drive currents up to 1 A at voltages from 4.5 V to 36 V. The device is designed to drive inductive loads such as relays, solenoids, dc and bipolar stepping motors, as well as other high-current/high-voltage loads in positive-supply applications. All inputs are compatible with TTL-and low-level CMOS logic. Each output (Y) is a complete totem-pole driver with a Darlington transistor sink and a pseudo-Darlington source. Drivers are enabled in pairs with drivers 1 and 2 enabled by 1,2EN and drivers 3 and 4 enabled by 3,4EN. When an enable input is high, the associated drivers are enabled and their outputs become active and in phase with their inputs. When the enable input is low, those drivers are disabled and their outputs are off and in a high-impedance state. With the proper data inputs, each pair of drivers form a full-H (or bridge) reversible drive suitable for solenoid or motor applications. A separate supply voltage (V CC1) is provided for the logic input circuits to minimize device power dissipation. Supply voltage V CC2 is used for the output circuits. The SN754410 is designed for operation from-40°C to 85°C.},

@article{ADCMFBTI,
abstract = {While the Multiple FeedBack (MFB) filter topology is well-known, its application to very high dynamic range analog-to-digital converter (ADC) interfaces requires a careful consideration of component value selection. This application report develops the ideal transfer function, then introduces a component selection methodology and discusses its impact on noise and distortion. The impact of amplifier Gain Bandwidth Product on final pole locations is also included, showing several examples. A complete high dynamic range, differential I/O filter for wide dynamic range ADC driving is then designed. A simple design spreadsheet embodying this design approach is available for download with this application report.},

abstract = {The OPA344 and OPA345 series rail-to-rail CMOS operational amplifiers are designed for precision, low-power, miniature applications. The OPA344 is unity gain stable, while the OPA345 is optimized for gains greater than or equal to five, and has a gain-bandwidth product of 3MHz. The OPA344 and OPA345 are optimized to operate on a single supply from 2.5V and up to 5.5V with an input common-mode voltage range that extends 300mV beyond the supplies. Quiescent current is only 250$\mu$A (max). Rail-to-rail input and output make them ideal for driving sampling analog-to-digital converters. They are also well suited for general purpose and audio applications and providing I/V conversion at the output of D/A converters. Single, dual and quad versions have identical specs for design flexibility. A variety of packages are available. All are specified for operation from –40{\textordmasculine}C to 85{\textordmasculine}C. A SPICE macromodel for design analysis is available for download from www.ti.com.},
