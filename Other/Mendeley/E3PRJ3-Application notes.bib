@article{ADCMFBTI,
abstract = {While the Multiple FeedBack (MFB) filter topology is well-known, its application to very high dynamic range analog-to-digital converter (ADC) interfaces requires a careful consideration of component value selection. This application report develops the ideal transfer function, then introduces a component selection methodology and discusses its impact on noise and distortion. The impact of amplifier Gain Bandwidth Product on final pole locations is also included, showing several examples. A complete high dynamic range, differential I/O filter for wide dynamic range ADC driving is then designed. A simple design spreadsheet embodying this design approach is available for download with this application report.},

@article{AN682,
abstract = {Beyond the primitive transistor, the operational ampli- fier is the most basic building block for analog applica- tions. Fundamental functions such as gain, load isolation, signal inversion, level shifting, adding and/or subtracting signals are easily implemented with this building block. More complex circuits can also be implemented, such as the instrumentation amplifier, a current to voltage converter, and filters, to name only a few. Regardless of the level of complexity of the opera- tional amplifier circuit, knowing the fundamental opera- tion and behavior of this building block will save a considerable amount of upfront design time.},

@article{OPA344Data,
abstract = {The OPA344 and OPA345 series rail-to-rail CMOS operational amplifiers are designed for precision, low-power, miniature applications. The OPA344 is unity gain stable, while the OPA345 is optimized for gains greater than or equal to five, and has a gain-bandwidth product of 3MHz. The OPA344 and OPA345 are optimized to operate on a single supply from 2.5V and up to 5.5V with an input common-mode voltage range that extends 300mV beyond the supplies. Quiescent current is only 250$\mu$A (max). Rail-to-rail input and output make them ideal for driving sampling analog-to-digital converters. They are also well suited for general purpose and audio applications and providing I/V conversion at the output of D/A converters. Single, dual and quad versions have identical specs for design flexibility. A variety of packages are available. All are specified for operation from –40{\textordmasculine}C to 85{\textordmasculine}C. A SPICE macromodel for design analysis is available for download from www.ti.com.},
